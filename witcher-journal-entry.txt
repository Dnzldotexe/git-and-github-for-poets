With two wishes down and one more to go, Geralt reported back to Olgierd. There he received his third and final task, which, following in 
the vein of the its predecessors, seemed nigh unto impossible to complete. Olgierd wanted Geralt to find and bring him the violet rose he 
had given his wife the last time he saw her. As this was many years ago, and flowers are not noted for their longevity, the rose had 
certainly disintegrated by now. Yet since Geralt had grown used to finding the unfindable and doing the undoable, he nevertheless set out
to try to recover this flower of yesteryear.

Olgierd's abandoned residence was haunted by the ghost of his wife, Iris von Everec – or more accurately, by deadly spectral emanations 
coming from her dormant spirit. Geralt had to overcome many obstacles before finally awakening Iris' ghost from her tortured sleep so he 
could talk to her about the violet rose. After he did so, he traveled to the world of the ghost's imagination to revive memories repressed 
within it and defeat the embodiments of Iris' fears.

At its end, our hero emerged from the imagined world not with the rose itself, but with a very faithful likeness of it painted by Iris von 
Everec herself. In this way he fulfilled the letter of Olgierd's wish – the rose has been delivered, though in painted form, and with the 
eyes of Iris von Everec staring out of its canvas.
