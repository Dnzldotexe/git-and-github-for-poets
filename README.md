# To take the rose or to not take the rose 
I can't make my choice.  
You either end Iris von Everec or you give her hope that someday, Olgierd will come visit.  
I first thought that taking the rose is the best choice, because you end Iris' suffering and free the demons (the Dog and the Cat) by her side.  
The latter choice isn't much morally worse, but rather a more poetic one. Olgierd, now with a living heart, could someday (I hope), reunite with his wife.  
I know it's such a slim possibility, and it may not even happen.  
It's such a shame that there are only two endings, and I can't make my choice.
